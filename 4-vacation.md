# Chapter 4 - Traveling

I consider myself to have been blessed to go on many different trips and vacations.  Some of those happened before my married years and some happened after.  I don't remember all of my teachers very well, but I do remember Senor Bryant, who was my Spanish teacher when I was a senior.  He strongly urged us to embrace travel as much as possible, I don't even remember all the places he had been, but from an adolescent's perspective, he seemed very fulfilled in life.

Several of my family vacations were memorable.  I remember camping all the way to my grandmother's house in Ohio, and back again.  One time my Mom took all the kids out to see the other grandmother via Greyhound bus and we all caught chicken pox, starting with my oldest sister and working down to me, the youngest.  Another time we went to visit the same grandmother in Sacramento, but this time we took the redeye flight.  I think that was the first time I flew.

##  Sacramento

There were a lot of things about California that were different from what I was used to.  First of all, my grandmother did not have air conditioning, but that was no matter - because the Delta breeze brought temperatures down to 50 degrees at night, even in the middle of summer.  There was a bamboo forest with towering eucalyptus trees at the end of the street where she lived.  I don't remember how many cousins I had at the time of my visits, but I ended up having 10 just from one uncle and aunt.  While my sisters were languishing away with the pox, my uncle took me and the oldest cousins out to do stuff.  I think that was some of the most fun I had.  We shot BB guns, played baseball, went to every playground and swimming hole.  My grandfather hadn't planted anything but fruit trees in his yard, so my oldest sister made homemade apple pie from the tree out back.  My grandfather was alive the first time I went, but not the second.  He had ALS, which is a terrible disease.  The second time I went, I got to ride on my uncle's boat, which was quite large.

## Lima

I would say my other grandmother was a bit opposite.  She definitely shared her opinion without reserve.  I had a lot of fun at her house as well.  In the days before cell phones, I guess we would always call when we were a few hours out and give warning that we were about to decend in full force.  I remember her asking what each of us kids wanted.  Both of my grandmothers were generous, but both in different ways.  My grandmother lived in a mobile home and had a Nintendo.  I remember playing Duck Hunt with my sisters.  We did some of the same things in Ohio, it was definitely more rural then where I grew up.  I also got to meet my great-grandmother a few times.  She was, in the language of the times, "a hoot".  The first time I visited, she was living in a very old house.

## Cozumel

My wife and I took a cruise for our 5 year anniversary.  You won't ever understand the paradigm shift from "I'm hungry" to "I could eat again" until you've experienced the 3 big all you can meals per day - along with the late night snack bars, etc.  The shows were very interesting, it was also a lot of fun to make the rounds of the different boat levels.  It's entertaining to see international performers do dead on covers of American and British songs.  Just out of sick curiosity, I wonder how the cruise ship industry recruits such talent from all over the world.  Even the service staff seem extraordinarily talented in civility.  I won't ever forget a lot those experiences.

One experience I particularly remember and is oft quoted at house happened at one of the clubs.  I think my wife and I would get a drink to split or just a coke so we could enjoy the live music.  Well, there was a smooth Italian boat captain trying to schmooze over a young lady next to us.  Before her friends came to rescue her, we heard this phrase we we often use at home, "Trust me - I'm a professional - it's what I do."  You do have to say it with an accent though.  The excursion was memorable, we chose the cheap option of bike riding and snorkeling.  I wrote a Facebook memoir regarding a haggling experience.  You can probably dig it up somewhere.

## New Mexico and Colorado

Our first big family vacation was to Colorado for family church camp.  We also decided to swing by my wife's brother's cabin in Taos.  I was(am) not a great family vacationer.  I'm still learning the art of not being grumpy when I'm off my routine.  We had the great idea of leaving at 3 AM and making to it to Taos in one day.  Everything was working out great until we ended up lost around dinnertime.  It's beautiful up in the mountains, but the stresses of car trouble young children took a toll over a few days.  Our next destination was the YMCA of the Rockies in Este's Park.  Once again, it was beautiful country, but there were some challenges of having the whole family in a pretty small cabin room.  We actually went back two more times after that.  One time I climbed a 12,000ft something mountain with a friend and discovered my physical limits.  I like the mountains, once I'm actually there - but my wife prefers the beach, so I don't know when I'll be there next.

##  Hawaii

Our next big anniversary was the 10 year mark and Amy saved up some credit card miles for a trip to Kauai.  We got in late at night and drove the additional 1 and a half hours to the condo in complete darkness and drizzling rain.  When I woke up the next morning, I cannot remember feeling so completely awed by my surrounding.  Our porch view had giant green mountains with equally dazzling flowers in view.  I think the middle of the island was one of the wettest places on earth.  The hidden beaches and sleepy little towns on that island are amazing.  The hiking is great, but my wife isn't a fan.  The snorkeling is amazing, if a little hazardous with the shallow coral, high waves and beating sun.  The most harrowing aspect is the abundance of one way bridges.  I think I ruffled a few feathers during my short driving tenure.  We went back to Kauai once again and most recently went to Maui to get a different experience.

## Beijing

I was blessed to go teach a month long English camp with my alma mater after my first year of teaching.  It was a bit of nail biter waiting for my passport and visa, because I got a late start on my paperwork and mailed off the first set of paperwork without the right documents.  It was also a bit unsettling to be flying internationally without anybody else.  The long flights are tough for me, I get very restless.  Jet lag is a real struggle for me.  Getting through the first couple of days of orientation was a challenge, I remember they took us to a *very* fancy resturant, where they brought course after course for us to try.  I was fighting a gigantic headache the whole time, which had a devastation impact on my appetite.

China was a lot of fun.  I liked how everything was accessible and within walking or bus distance.  I liked the different types of food and the markets and shops.  The actual teaching was fun.  The kids over there are accustomed to very rigid activity.  Just like every other child in the world, they enjoyed any type of hands on activity much more than rote schoolwork.  We introduced them to lots of different American customs and holidays - like Easter, Thanksgiving, and Christmas.  The teacher's aide assigned to me was a tremendous help.  The school that hosted us made sure we experienced all of the best sights of Beijing.  In one month, I got to see the Great Wall, the Summer Palace, the Forbidden City and the Chinese acrobats.

## England, Ireland and Wales

Also as a benefit of teaching, I chaperoned a trip to the UK.  We flew into Ireland and went to some famous castles, along with experiencing St. Patrick's Day in Dublin.  It was extremely cold and we stood for a long time, just waiting for the parade to start, and we had two rows of people in front of us.  We took a boat over to Wales and got to drive through some beautiful countryside.  We went to Shakespeare's childhood home and ended our trip in London.  I was surprised by the diversity in that huge city.  Once again, I remember that it was much colder than I like.  Also, English food is not my favorite.  The best thing I had over there was some meat filled pastry.

## Daulphin Island

Our current favorite family vaction spot is in Alabama.  We like the island, which doesn't have a single stoplight.  It's also very flat - which makes for great bike rides.  There's a choice of three different beaches.  Recently, I've started enjoying fishing from the shore for the small variety of fish that inhabit the shallow waters.  The beachhouse has a pair of kayaks - which gives rise to one of the more humorous stories in family lore.  One time I sent my youngest son out with a life vest and a paddle.  The paddle was a complete waste of time, he just held it in his lap as he started to drift farther and farther away from the shore.  It was March and I felt little interest in jumping in to save him, so I ran back and grabbed a long piece of floor trim that he could grab to.  By the time I reached out, he had gone further and the trim broke when I tried to extend it.  I then did the logical thing and ran back for a longer piece, but thankfully my older son decided to be hero and jumped in and tugged him back to shore.  Nobody in my family will let me forget that un-glamorous moment.
