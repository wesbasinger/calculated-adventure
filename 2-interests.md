# Chapter 2 - Interests

My personality has an inclination towards being very interested with something for a period of time and then moving on to something else.  When I took a Strength Finder test for a teacher workshop, *Learner* was one of my qualities.  I don't remember any of the others, but I definitely agreed with that assessment.  Expanding my sphere of interests and knowledge has always been an enjoyable pursuit.

When I was a child, the library was the best outlet for this.  I remember going and checking out 20 books at a time on whatever subject I was interested in.  Here's a list of obsessions that I can remember.

- Sailing
- Calligraphy
- Guns
- Baseball
- Guinea pigs
- Woodwork
- Skateboarding
- Chess
- Horses
- World War II
- American history
- Outdoor survival
- Musical instruments

I know there are more, those are just the ones I can remember.  I would always dream up some wild plan to experience or learn more with hands on practice.  Reflecting back on that list, most of those items still interest me and it's interesting how some of the strands have been woven into my past.  I've only been sailing a few times, if someone gave me a boat, I would be willing to give it a try.  My calligraphy teacher has been very involved in my kid's lives as the nursery director.  I've gotten the chance to shoot a variety of guns over the years.  I played baseball up until the junior high years and got to play church softball for a few summers.

The guinea pig phase was a bust.  After the rodent craze wore off - my mom found someone giving away a free pair, nope - not interested.  Working with wood remains of great interest to me, it's something I keep coming back to and recently I've started making tables and benches for people as a very unprofitable, but fulfilling side business.  My teenage daughter just bought a skateboard, but she has about as much enduring passion for the sport as I did.  I headed up chess teams at both charter schools that I taught at and was able to go to the state tournament with both schools.

As an adult, I've added a passion for technology.  For the last couple of years, I've been interested in writing computer code and learning ways to integrate algorithms into whatever current interest I have.  I started using online interactive coding tutorials in the summer of 2012.  I don't think I'll ever lose the desire to type computer commands.  Our first computer was an older machine and ran a DOS operating system.  I was quite surprised to find 15 years later the command line was still the most efficient way to give a computer a set of instructions.  I have been very impressed with some free online resources I used to build my experience.  I took MIT's introductory computer science class and Harvard's CS50 online and enjoyed both tremendously.

I remember taking a class in college that said something to the effect of you'll never be able to make money doing all the things you love, so that's why hobbies exist.  I would say I'm always preoccupied with a hobby, often to the detriment of my wife and family.  One of my personal challenges is learning the balance between amateur interest and people.  Time is a great gift and it's best not to hoard it to yourself.  I've found that I can enjoy my hobbies more if they're not taking time away from my wife or kids.
