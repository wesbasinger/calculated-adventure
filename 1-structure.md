# Chapter 1 - Structure

I was homeschooled.  I feel that's one of the most famous disclaimers in the world.  In uttering that strange phrase, you could be making an excuse - or just bragging.  In this case, I am offering an excuse.  I have many of the marks of a homeschooler, and one of them is a guilt about lack of structure.  I was not a great fan of writing as a child, but we had these rote forms for every kind of essay.  They were called PET sheets, and I don't remember the significance of the acronym, beyond P = Persuasive.  As in, I was never *persuaded* about the effectiveness of before mentioned sheets.  I do remember it was important to have an outline, but I have no such thing in mind as I sit down to this endeavor.

Instead of structure, I propose you read along with me as I exhaust every subject of personal interest, and then perhaps you will have been slightly entertained or enlightened at the end.  As I start, I am also reminded that you must "know your audience" when you begin to communicate a message.  Somewhat unnervingly, I don't know who I want to read this yet.  Stay tuned.

I think I had a somewhat illuminating experience last night.  I watched this fascinating show called "Love on the Spectrum".  The basic premise of the show was following a group of wonderfully made young adults that happened to have some challenges with social skills due to their diagnosis of autism or asperger's.  I'm not sure whether I struggle in the same way, or just have empathy, but their difficulties seemed very relatable.  I never felt odd until my teenage years, but then I started noticing a slight difference between things I was interested in and what my friends were interested in.  I'm fairly grateful I grew up in a time when you had to leave your house to have fun and play games, high speed internet would have been a detriment (as my freshman year in college proved).

## Headgear

I wonder what percentage of children have to wear headgear?  I haven't seen very many kids of late with anything of the sort fastened round their neck.  I remember the "Summer of Headgear" quite well.  One story sticks out to me in particular.  I do remember that I was greatly repressed into an indoor state during that season.  We had the schedule worked out to where most of my time was logged while sleeping, but there were a few daytime hours I had to get in as well.  My family believes in structure and following the rules, so I never missed any required hours.  One evening, my friend wanted to go fishing, but I hadn't gotten in enough stretchy time.  I was torn between the desire to get out of the house and the embarrassment of being seen like a bridled animal.  I don't remember what persuaded me, my family, my friend or my boredom - but I did get out of the house.  One thing I remember vividly was how little my friend seemed to care I looked like a restrained beast (what I pictured myself as).

Years later and weeks ago, I had an experience where my wife and I were headed to a fancy wedding and she gasped as she walked behind me and hurriedly pulled up alongside and said, "You have a gigantic red stain on the back of your pants!"  Horrified, I asked her what I should do.  She said, "Just keep going - I'll try to stay behind you."  At that moment, I would have worn 10 pairs of headgear rather than suffer the shame I felt I was about to endure.  We hurriedly shuffled down the row to our saved seats next to our oldest daughter who asked what we had been arguing about as we came in.  I dutifully stood and sat all through the service, growing more red every time I looked down at the white seat and saw the red smear.  The only thing that made the situation better was being able to logically understand how the back of my pants had gotten a red stain.  Whilst the messages was shared and the vows exchanged, I was able to logically reduce that my two year old had smeared lipstick across the driver side seat while I had been caught up trying to finish a personal project in the garage.  Every choice has consequences.

I love my wife, she followed me out to the car after the ceremony and helped me baby wipe the stain into submission.  We went back into the reception hall and I felt most at ease when I was finally able to acknowledge the whole embarrassing event in front of some long time friends (also my work boss).  What do I gain by sharing all of that?  I suppose the salient point is that people probably care very little about the things that bother you.

As far as being on the spectrum, I have a tough time with hugs.  Being six foot, I figure I should always go high on the side hug, but it rarely goes off without a hitch.  If you have a foolproof strategy for how to deal with huggers, please write me.
