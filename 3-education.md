# Chapter 3 - Education

I was homeschooled from grade 1 to grade 8.  If there is any credit due for success in that endeavor, it is due to my mother.  She embraced a very structured approach.  I learned some key skills early on in life.

1. The sooner you start, the sooner the work is done.
2. Reading is a great way to learn about things you can't experience first hand.
3. Complaining doesn't get you as far as effort.
4. Field trips are memorable.

The first two years of high school were spent at a private school founded on a university model.  We attended classes three days a week and had homework the other two.  I really enjoyed attending there, I realized that I could be competitive with grades - I always enjoyed comparing scores to my peers.  Now I realize that wasn't a very upright motivation.  I remember algebra class, I had done some workbooks the year before in homeschool - so the work was familiar to me and I may not have been the most attentive student.  One time, the teacher got so exasperated with me she handed me a stack of homework to grade.  I remember feeling very important.  She quit a short time after.  I did Model UN Debate in my sophomore year, that was great fun.

For my last two years of high school, I went to a public high school with probably close to 1800 students.  I enjoyed my career tech classes.  It's somewhat humorous that I've been able to apply elements of both classes to my current field.  I took CAD and electronics, and currently I do sales and customer service for a contract manufacturer, where we do circuit board, cable and box build assemblies.  I think career and tech classes in high school are a great idea because they can help students align their interests with possible future leadings.  We also had multiplayer first person shooter tournaments in my electronics class along with unfettered access to the internet, so that was an upside.

College was a bit of a bumpy road.  My first semester was at Texas A&M, and I did not do as well as my parents would have liked for as much money as they spent.  I was in the Corp of Cadets, and while it may have been a very short period of my life, it did have an impact on me.  I really don't remember trying to pay attention at all, I think I was fairly overwhelmed by living away from home for the first time.  It was something I wanted to do, but I definitely wasn't prepared.  I came home and took a few classes, but took a break until I was married.  One of my recollections from community college was the dilemma of walking home versus waiting 3 hours for my dad to pick me up on his way home.  At least a few times I just stayed up at school and read an entire volume of the LOTR trilogy.  One time I walked the 5 miles home and got picked up by a pair of Army recruiters.

I don't remember what was the motivation for going back to school, but I did end up back in evening classes after I got married.  I took a few year of evening and online classes from community college.  I wholeheartedly endorse our local system, the professors were very engaged with the students.  I can honestly say I didn't have a single junior college professor that didn't care about my academic advancement.  To this day, I remember my economics professor explain how gas prices are a function of supply and demand.  It funny I ended up as a math major, I took Precalculus three times in college, and it was actually the last time I took it via an online class that sparked my interest in becoming a math major.  I still remember driving home late at night with the windows down and the classic rock turned up, 9 or 10 in the cool fall or spring air.

As much as I can remember, I only toured 2 different universities.  I think I was leaning towards a math or education major.  I really enjoyed my time at Dallas Baptist University.  I always felt a bit of an oddball, most of the students were traditional, straight out of high school students - but I still feel a very strong connection to that school and go back when I can for homecoming.  I ended up with a major in math and a minor in Biblical studies.
